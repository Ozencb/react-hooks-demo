# A Useless React Projectâœ¨
This project is created mainly to understand and demonstrate how React hooks work; it has no real use.
Target audience is people that are new to React but has some web development experience, so advanced React developers will probably find this boring.
I tried to explain what is going on by adding lots of comments, hopefully it helps.

## Preview

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

By default, the app will launch at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
